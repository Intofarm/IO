            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            
            <div class="steps-list">
                <div class="step">You purchase an Investment Account. For example, a MINI-RANCH for $100.</div>
                <div class="step">Each month, the Account provides you with 450 eggs.</div>
                <div class="step">15 eggs at $0.20 cents each = $3.</div>
                <div class="step">Bimonthly, you would receive 900 eggs worth $240.</div>
                <div class="step">If you purchase a VIP account linked to your user ID, your account can receive a multiplier of up to 3 (maximum x3) and you'll earn an additional percentage based on the VIP level acquired (Tune, Vermut, or Jabalí).<br>
                Thus, for each VIP account, you'll receive the maximum additional percentage of eggs that can be stored. See the Multipliers table below.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>SUGGESTION:</strong><br>
                The most popular account is the <strong>POULTRY VERMUT</strong> for $1500 USD. It yields $660 per month.
            </div>
            
            <p>The money received from investors who invest in a real account. For example, 4000 users have purchased a $400 Account. This represents $1.6 million in modern investment contracts. Purchasing an account provides real money through the TRON blockchain mechanism via USDT (Tether) on the TRC20 network.</p>
            
            <p>Part of the profits from this money is returned to investors' accounts monthly as income. Therefore, you're participating in joint investments and receiving your share of the profits.</p>
            
            <p>High profit percentages are possible through investment capital management (100%), participation in venture capital investments (20%), funding profitable projects (70%), and improving the performance of existing businesses (40% when available) through purchasing new equipment and expansion. In other words, your money works for you in real business.</p>
